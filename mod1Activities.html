<p>Start by log in the Linux server.</p>
<p>Windows User:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download putty. Go to the putty <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/download.html" target="_blank">download page</a>, and download putty.exe</li>
<li>Run putty.exe:</li>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>fill in host name: syccuxas01.pcc.edu</li>
<li>fill in saved session name: any name you prefer, then click on save</li>
<li>click on open</li>
<li>you will see a prompt "login as: " Type in your login name which is the same as your mypcc login name followed by enter key press. At the prompt "Password: "&nbsp; type in the default password which is your pcc G number with captial G followed by enter key press. As you type, nothing will show for security reason. Just keep on typing.</li>
<li>change your password by typing in command "passwd"</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Mac or Linux User:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>open the terminal window</p>
</li>
<li>type in command "ssh loginName@syccuxas01.pcc.edu" where loginName is your mypcc login name.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be developing your code in Linux. It's essential that you are familiar with Linux and development tools such as editor, g++, makefile and gdb.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://vic.gedris.org/Manual-ShellIntro/1.2/ShellIntro.pdf" target="_blank">simple introduction to shell commands</a><a href="http://www.openvim.com/" target="_blank"></a></p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.openvim.com/" target="_blank">A vi tutorial</a></li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.vietspring.org/cpp_linux/gpp.html" target="_blank">A g++ tutorial</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.unknownroad.com/rtfm/gdbtut/gdbtoc.html" target="_blank">A gdb tutorial</a></p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCtY--xRUyI" target="_blank">One more gdb tutorial</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, make sure you can compile and run the program <a href="hello/hello/HelloWorld.cpp">HelloWorld.cpp</a>. The steps you can do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a directory in your home directory for this course: mkdir cs162</li>
<li>go to cs162: cd cs162</li>
<li>create a subdirectory for hello world test: mkdir testHello</li>
<li>go to testHello: cd testHello</li>
<li>create the source file hello.cpp by using an editor. If you know vi or emacs, you can use that. If not, nano is an easier to use one: nano hello.cpp. Use control-O to save and control-X to exit. See the command list at the bottom of the nano screen.</li>
<li>compile the code: g++ -o myHello hello.cpp (you can call it myHello or anything else)</li>
<li>run the program: ./myHello</li>
</ul>
<p>Read and study the following chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>an overview of computers and programming languages</li>
<li>basic elements of C++</li>
<li>input/output</li>
<li>namespaces, the class string, and user-defined simple data types</li>
<li>records (structs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please don't let the number of chapters scare you. Most likely you are fairly familiar with the materials from your first programming class. If most of them are new concepts for you, you should reconsider about taking this class this term.</p>
<p>When you feel you have finished studying the material of chapters, you need to complete the on-line quiz by the end of this week. You have two possible attempts at this quiz, and your highest score counts. You will find this quiz in the table of contents for this module. There is also a 5 question practice quiz which will be available all term for you to take as many times as you like. It has nothing to do with C++, but is availble for you to learn how desire2learn handles quizzes in general, and to check that your computer, network, and browser are configured correctly to handle Blackboard quizzes.</p>
<p>Now it is time for some hands on programming time. You need to work on Project #1 and lab1. This can be found in the Assignment topic of this module. It is essential that your coding style follows the <a href="styleGuide.doc">style guidelines </a>for this class. Use of good style and good program design is a requirement for a good score on each assignment. In this class, form is of equal importance to function. Note that this class uses C++, so please refrain from using any of your old C constructs, if any. In particular, the use of printf and scanf is not permitted. You must use namespace std, iostream (rather than iostream.h) etc, cin, and cout. Please be sure to follow the style guidelines mentioned previously.</p>
<p>Before you begin with Project1, I strongly urge you to view the videos on "Module 1 Video Lecture" page. They demonstrate the concepts involved. I will include more videos in Module 2 to help you with Project1.</p>
<p>By the way, as a registered PCC student you may also use the tutoring services that are available in the TCB building (top floor) on the Sylvania campus. Please check <a href="http://spot.pcc.edu/computers/tutors.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a> for further information.</p>
<p>I know there is a lot to do this first week! Good luck!</p>
